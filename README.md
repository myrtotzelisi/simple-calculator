# Homepage HTML & CSS

This project showcases a simple, yet elegant homepage. It represents my first try to create a homepage using *only* HTML and CSS. It was part of the "HTML and CSS in Depth" course of the Meta Front-End Developer certificate.

#### Project Overview

The homepage features a structured layout with a header, main content, and footer. The design is responsive and crafted to meet the needs of the client's target audience.

#### Features

- **Header**: Contains the client's logo.
- **Main Content**: Features a large promotional banner and three columns with text and images.
- **Footer**: Divided into two columns: one with a small logo and the other with copywriting information.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the page looks good on devices of all sizes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and professional design tailored to the target audience.
